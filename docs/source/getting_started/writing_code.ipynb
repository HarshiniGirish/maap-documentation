    "\n",
    "[**NOTE simplify this section here and reference the new [Custom environments](../system_reference_guide/custom-environments.ipynb) documentation**]\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend managing your environments using conda. MAAP comes with conda preinstalled, and a base environment that includes common packages for geospatial analysis. However, you will probably want additional packages for your analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we recommend installing `mamba` into the base environment. This will take a few minutes (especially solving the environment), but only has to be done once (per running workspace session) and will make future environment creation and changes much faster!\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Go to File -> New -> Terminal to open up a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge mamba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed `mamba`, replace all `conda` calls below with `mamba` calls for much faster execution!\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Because modifications to the base conda environment are reset after every workspace restart, you will have to re-install mamba into the base environment after every workspace restart. Future iterations of MAAP will have mamba installed in the base environment, but we don’t have access to those updates yet. However, you do not need to have mamba installed to activate conda environments you have already created (even if they were created using mamba), so you only need to (re-)install mamba when you need to create or modify conda environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended approach is to use environment YML files. For example, create a file like the following called `newenv2.yml`:\n",
    "\n",
    "newenv2.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "name: newenv2\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "\t- conda-forge\n",
    "\t- defaults\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "\t- mamba\n",
    "\t- python=3.8\n",
    "\t- ipykernel\n",
    "\t- pandas\n",
    "\t- geopandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, from a terminal, you can create this environment with a command like: \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f newenv2.yml\n",
    "``` \n",
    "This command may take a few minutes to run and may appear to hang on “Solving Environment” (depending on the complexity of your environment). However, in most cases, it should eventually solve the environment and complete the installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Custom environments are deleted, and modifications to the base conda environment (e.g., installing mamba) are reset, when the workspace is Stopped. To preserve a custom environment after the workspace shutdowns, create the environment that is saved to the home directory instead of the default system directory for environments. Make sure to not make a conda env inside a git-tracked folder, or if you do add it to the `.gitignore`. If git is tracking an env, it could cause your workspace to crash. This can be done via the following commands, to create the environment at the path `./myenvs/testenv` with the flag `-p` and to activate it using the full path:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mamba env create -f env.yml -p ./myenvs/testenv\n",
    "conda  activate ./myenvs/testenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that if the YAML file contains the `ipykernel` package, the kernel is automatically registered with Jupyter and shows up under the Notebook kernel options.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use conda first for installing packages, and pip only if no conda package is available. You can install pip and pip packages in the same YML file. Make sure to list pip separately from the pip packages list like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "newenv2.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "name: newenv2\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "\t- conda-forge\n",

    "dependencies:\n",
    "\t- mamba\n",

    "\t- pip\n",
    "\t- pip: \n",
    "- futures \n",
    "- pprintpp \n",
    "- pathlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of individually listing pip packages, you can also replace the package list with `-r requirements.txt` if you have your packages listed in a text file like requirements.txt. It is recommended to use the first method.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t- pip\n",
    "\t- pip: \n",
    "- -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make your environment accessible via Jupyter:\n",
    "Make sure you have installed `ipykernel` as a dependency in your environment YAML file.\n",
    "Step (1) should automatically register the environment with Jupyter, making it accessible from the notebook interface. If for some reason that doesn’t work, from a terminal, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activate the environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a package to an environment, the recommended approach is:\n",
    "Add the package to the dependencies list of your environment’s YAML file.\n",
    "Run \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env update -f your_environment_file.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your conda environment is associated with a path rather than a name, you should make sure to (1) remove the environment name from your `environment_file.yaml`, and (2) run this command with the `-p /path/to/yourenv` prefix, in other words:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env update -f your_environment_file.yml -p /path/to/your_environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help you track what is in your environment in case you need to re-create it in the future, and will ensure that all packages are mutually consistent with each other.\n"
