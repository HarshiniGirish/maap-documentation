    "### An overview of the MAAP platform\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAAP is a cloud-based system to write science-analysis code and then run it at scale. This lets you keep all of the input and output data “in the cloud”.  It is composed of a few parts:\n",
    " \n",
    " - The **Algorithm Development Environment (ADE)** in Jupyter, where code is written and tested before moving to scaled-execution. Typically this is either with Python or R. The MAAP platform provides a helper library called maap.py to run the system commands from Python. Code is stored in a public GitHub repository to help with collaboration and also prepare for the Algorithm Registration step.\n",
    " - The **Algorithm Catalog**, where your analysis algorithms can be registered and compiled for use by the DPS. The MAAP system provides a tab in Jupyter to help you register your algorithms.\n",
    " - The **Data Processing System (DPS)** is where algorithms in the Algorithm Catalog can be run at scale in the cloud. The MAAP system provides a Jupyter GUI to run Jobs, or the maap.py library can be used to run a batch of Jobs in a loop using Python.\n",
    " - The DPS also has monitoring capabilities, and again the MAAP system provides a Jupyter GUI to help monitor Jobs. This can also be done using maap.py in Python.\n",
    " - There is also a RESTful API that sits under the maap.py library. You can access that API directly if you prefer.\n",
    " - [Do we need to have something about MAAP STAC? Or where the data is stored and where output data goes?]\n",
