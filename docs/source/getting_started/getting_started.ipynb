    "\n",
    "#### Generate a Public SSH Key\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need an SSH key for your personal machine. Here are [example instructions for creating an SSH key](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/cloud-at-customer/occ-get-started/generate-ssh-key-pair.html). Note that there are different instructions for Windows and unix-based systems (MacOS, Linux). The outcome of this will be a Public SSH key on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add the Public SSH Key to MAAP\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, you cannot see or edit hidden files in the MAAP Jupyter account. Therefore, you should do the following workaround:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On your local computer, copy the contents of the public SSH key you just created. It will usually have a `.pub` extension (the default file is `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) and its contents will look something like this (one long line):\n",
    "\n",
    "    `ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza[...]TeDx1 ashiklom@gs610-ashiklom.ndc.nasa.gov`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the Jupyter interface (right click in the file browser) to create a new folder in your home directory called `ssh`.\n",
    "3. Inside that folder, use the Jupyter interface (right click in the file browser) to create a new file called `authorized_keys` (NOTE: no file extension!).\n",
    "4. Double click the file you just created to open it in the editor.\n",
    "5. Copy the contents of your SSH key from your computer into this file. Save it and close it.\n",
    "6. Return to your home directory, right click the `ssh` folder, click “Rename”, and rename it to `.ssh` (period in front). You will get a 404 error, but the operation will have succeeded, and folder will ‘disappear’.\n",
    "     - To check that this worked, in a terminal window, run `ls -a` in your home directory. You should see the `.ssh` folder in there.\n",
    "7. Repeat these steps to add more SSH keys from different machines.\n",
    "     - Note that, to see the `.ssh` folder from JupyterLab, you’ll need to temporarily rename it to `ssh`. The only way to do this is via the terminal — `mv .ssh ssh`. Don’t forget to rename it back to `.ssh` when you’re done!\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a MAAP workspace over SSH, you will need a workspace-specific IP address and port. You can find this by going to the JupyterLab commands menu — the 4th button in the left panel of the Jupyter interface; shows a looking glass over a list; alternatively, press Control + Shift + C (Command + Shift + C on Mac) — and search for “SSH”. You’ll see “Display SSH Info”. Click this button. A dialog box with the correct SSH command will appear.\n",
