    "The MAAP DPS (Data Processing System) let you run an Algorithm at scale, in the cloud. It is different from running a Jupyter notebook in that it is non-interactive. Therefore, when migrating a notebook to the DPS it needs to be altered to take all of the input parameters at once as a command-line program. Even if you start with a command-line script, there are best practices to follow when preparing it for the DPS. Once that is done, the Algorithm can be Registered in a way that allows you to execute analysis jobs using a web-based form, where each field is defined during the Registration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPS will then be able to take a set of inputs and process them at scale. You do not need to worry about scheduling or scaling your jobs. You can also run your DPS Algorithm using the maap.py Python library in a loop to execute a batch of jobs (e.g., 1000 input files and one job per input-file). The DPS will manage the compute resources to handle your request, and you can easily find all of your outputs as each individual job completes."

    "Once you have an algorithm such as the `gdal_wrapper`, or your own Jupyter Notebook, test it to make sure that it is running properly. If it runs properly in a Terminal window, you are one step closer to registering and running your algorithm in the DPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically a Jupyter Notebook is run interacively. A DPS algorithm will take all inputs up-front, do the processing, and produce output files. The `gdal_wrapper` script is already set up like a DPS algorithm. Some aspects to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python argparse**: Using a library like [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to accept input parameters helps to make the code more readable and easier to debug when working locally. It provides easy to write user-friendly command-line interface. \n",

    "### Testing as a DPS job locally within the workspace\n",

    "- Deactivate the current python virtual environment and activate the pre-installed conda environment (for the Basic Stable workspace, that is vanilla)\n",

    "- Create a directory called `input` and place any input files required by your algorithm. Here you will need to download any input files up-front, and then run your script. When you have registered your algorithm and run it in DPS, the input file can be passed in as a runtime parameter and DPS will automatically download it as part of the run.\n",
    "- Once the input directory is set up, `cd` back to the temporary directory and call your run script. This is the script you would like the DPS to run when your code is executing on the cloud. Note: This assumes you have already built the environment with required custom packages as mentioned in the build-env.sh of your algorithm. \n",
    "- If the `run_script` executes with no error, inspect your output directory for desired outputs. \n",
    "- If all desired outputs are created, you are one step closer to successfully running your algorithm on the DPS.\n",
    "- Next step is to proceed with registering your algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see below example on how to test your code locally using the `gdal` example. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DPS will get instructions on the environment from your `build-env.sh` script. To test the build script, start by making sure that your script's conda environment is not active, go to the gdal_wrapper folder and run `build-env.sh`:\n",
