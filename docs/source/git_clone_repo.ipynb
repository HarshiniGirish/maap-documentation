    "This example walks through cloning a repository into the ADE. Cloning a repository allows you to open, edit, and run files contained within the cloned repository. In this example, we look at cloning the \"MAAP-Project/maap-documentation\" Git repository, so that you are able to experiment with the code examples contained within this user documentation."

    "When inside of a workspace, we can use the **Git** tab at the top of the Jupyter window to see the option to **Clone**. We can also access the \"Clone a repo\" dialogue box by selecting the **File Browser** tab on the JupyterLab sidebar and using the **Git Clone** ![Git Clone](../_static/git_hub.png) button located at the top of the sidebar. The \"Clone a repo\" dialogue box prompts you to enter the URI of the repository you wish to clone. For this example we enter \" https://github.com/MAAP-Project/maap-documentation.git \". This can be found by visiting the [GitHub site for the \"MAAP-Project/maap-documentation\" Git repository](https://github.com/MAAP-Project/maap-documentation) and clicking the **Code** button. Then press the **CLONE** button to clone the repository into the ADE."
