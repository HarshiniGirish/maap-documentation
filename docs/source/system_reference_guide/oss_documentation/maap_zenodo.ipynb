    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- All fields under this section should be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your file does not have a DOI, select \"No\" under \"Digital Object Identifier\". A DOI will be created once uploaded and accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The publication date should be the day you submit your content for review, unless it was already published elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All co-authors should be listed under \"Creators\". If listed under creators, they will be included in the citation. Specific roles can be left blank, but we do recommend adding affiliations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A plain language summary should be provided under \"Description\". If applicable, an abstract can also be provided here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your content should have a license; to comply with open science, the license should be permissive. The default license is \"Creative Commons Attirbution 4.0 International\". For a list of other acceptable licenses, refer to our page on [Open Sourcing Code](./doi_and_licensing.ipynb).\n",

    "**Recommended Information**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember: co-authors should be listed in the previous section under \"Creators\" and not \"Contributors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keywords will help make your content searchable, and are up to the user to provide. Some recommended, general keywords for MAAP users can be: `Software` `Data Science` `Data Visualization` `Earth Science` `Open Science` `Data Exploration` `Biomass` `AGU 2023 (adjust conference/year as necessary)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Specific datasets can also be listed as a keyword, like `GEDI` or `ICESat` for example.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Parameters also make good keywords, like `Land cover` or `Canopy height`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide the language(s) your content is provided in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Dates\" is where you can add other dates besides the publishing date. For example, a presentation that was given previously at a conference can be provided with a type of \"Available\" and a description of \"Conference presentation\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- The publisher should be \"NASA MAAP\" or \"ESA MAAP\" for MAAP users.\n",
