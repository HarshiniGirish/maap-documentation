    "# How Do I Share My Workspace With Another MAAP User?\n",
    "1. In the workspaces tab under the Che side panel, select the workspace you want to share.\n",

    "![share workspace select](../../_static/faq_images/share_workspace_select.png) \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Under the Share section, click the button + Add Developer. Then type in the email of the person/people you wish to share the workspace with and click *Share*.  Only emails registered with MAAP can be used to share workspaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the workspace was opened under an organization, the workspace can only be shared with members of that organization and not any other MAAP user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently, we do not have a way to denote shared workspaces in the Che side panel, so we recommend renaming your workspace so that you know it is shared (e.g. add _s)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users who you share a workspace with will be able to see everything in your `my-private-bucket` folder and will have read, write, and delete permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be able to see what tabs other users have open by refreshing or clicking on the \"Running Terminals and Kernels\" side tab \n",
