There are a couple of [spatial filters available to search by](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#c-spatial) in the CMR including point, line, polygon, and bounding box. In this example, we will explore filtering with a bounding box which is a sequence of four latitude and longitude values in the order of `[W,S,E,N]`. "
